Well, it was a neat idea, buutttttttt...

1. WiFi download from the camera is teh SLOOWWS.  1MB/s max.
1. WiFi doesn't have an infrastructure mode.
1. Camera still continues recording while connected to WiFi and transferring.  Bitrate is faster than the WiFi transfer rate...
1. The camera's clock/timer seriously seems to get messed up in this mode.

So it makes the whole deal pretty much worthless.

Sux.
